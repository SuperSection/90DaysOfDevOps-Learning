## Challenges and Solutions

### Confusion between /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow file in Linux

**Solution:** Obversed how they can be opened, and what are the purposes of those two files

  - `/etc/passwd` is readable by the whole system to look up for user informations.
  - `/etc/shadow` stores encrypted passwords, and so it's only readable by *root* user.
