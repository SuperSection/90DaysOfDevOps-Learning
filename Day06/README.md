## My Learnings Today ðŸŽ¯

- **Linux Shell Basics:** Commands entered at the shell prompt have three basic parts
  - Command to run
  - Options to adjust the behavior of the command
  - Arguments, which are typically targets of the command

- Few Commands I learned:
  - `file` - scans a file's contents and displays what type it is
  - `passwd` - changes a user's own password
  - `wc` - counts lines, words, and characters in a file

- Learned few useful command-line-editing shortcuts
  - `Ctrl+a` - Jump to the beginning of the command line.
  - `Ctrl+e` - Jump to the end of the command line.
  - `Ctrl+u` - Clear from the cursor to the beginning of the command line.
  - `Ctrl+k` - Clear from the cursor to the end of the command line.
  - `Ctrl+Left` - Arrow Jump to the beginning of the previous word on the command line.
  - `Ctrl+Right` - Arrow Jump to the end of the next word on the command line.
  - `Ctrl+r` - Search the history list of commands for a pattern.
